### BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY(BSIT) STUDENT ATTENDANCE SYSTEM

#### Introduction: 
This Java console application utilizes a general tree data structure to monitor BSIT student attendance. It allows users to add student records under specific sections and view the entire class structure with detailed student information.

#### Describe what it can do:
The Student Attendance System enables users to manage and view student attendance in a structured manner. To use the system, select a year level (1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year, or 4th year), then choose a section within that year level. Once a section is selected, add students by entering their name and ID number. Lastly, you can also view the full attendance by selecting "People present by year level", which displays the entire class structure with detailed student information.

#### Why did you make that kind of application and how does it contribute to you or to the community: 
I created the Student Attendance System to organize and manage student attendance in an educational setting, particularly in our university. This application is not only a learning tool for me but it also has a contribution to the community. It helped me to enhance my programming and problem solving skills, particularly in Java and object oriented designs. By providing an efficient way to track student attendance across multiple sections and year levels, this system can benefit educational institutions, teachers, and staff, replacing complex paper-based systems. Overall, this project has been instrumental in developing my technical expertise.
