### STUDENT TRACKER SYSTEM

#### Introduction: 
The Student Tracker application is a console-based Java program that allows users to store, retrieve, and manage student data (ID and Name) using a hash table. It demonstrates hashing and provides efficient data storage and retrieval.

#### Describe what it can do:
The application allows users to add a student's ID and name to the hash table while preventing duplicate entries by checking if the ID already exists. It also enables users to quickly retrieve a student's name using their ID. It also provides a feature to display all students stored in the hash table, including their IDs and names.

#### Why did you make that kind of application and how does it contribute to you or to the community: 
I created this application to demonstrate how hashing works in Java. For me, this project strengthened my understanding of hashing and hash tables, improved my Java programming skills. For the community, it serves as an educational tool for beginners and demonstrates the practical use of hash tables in managing data efficiently, while providing a foundation for future projects.
