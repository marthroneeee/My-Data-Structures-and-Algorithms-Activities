### STUDENT RANKING SYSTEM

#### Introduction: 
This Java console application utilizes a heap data structure to check the students ranking. It allows users to add student names and scores and view the entire student ranking from highest to lowest.

#### Describe what it can do:
This Student Ranking System is a dynamic and efficient tool for managing and displaying rankings based on scores. Whether used for educational purposes, competitions, or gaming leaderboards, this program provides a reliable solution for ranking systems in real-world scenarios.

#### Why did you make that kind of application and how does it contribute to you or to the community: 
I created the Student Ranking System to demonstrate how data structures, specifically heaps, can be used in real-world applications like ranking students based on scores. It helps in learning and understanding priority queues and how to efficiently manage and sort data. It can be adapted for real-world use cases like classroom rankings, sports competitions, or gaming leaderboards.
