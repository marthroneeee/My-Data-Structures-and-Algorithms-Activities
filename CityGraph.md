### STUDENT TRACKER SYSTEM

#### Introduction: 
The Simple Map System is a Java program that allows users to create, store, and manage a network of connected locations (cities and roads) using a graph. It demonstrates the use of graph data structures, providing efficient storage and representation of connections between cities. The application enables users to add cities, connect them with roads, and display the entire network in an easy-to-read format.

#### Describe what it can do:
The Simple Map System application allows users to add cities to the network. It also enables users to connect two cities with roads, representing undirected edges in the graph. The users can also quickly view the entire road network, displaying all cities and their connected neighbors.

#### Why did you make that kind of application and how does it contribute to you or to the community: 
I created the Simple Map System application to demonstrate how graph data structures work in Java. For me, this project strengthened my understanding of graphs specially in adjacency lists. It also improved my problem-solving and programming skills. For the community, it serves as an educational tool for beginners to learn the fundamentals of graph-based data structures and how they can be used to model real-world systems like road networks, while providing a foundation for future projects.
